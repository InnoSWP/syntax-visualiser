## Motivation

> There are many programmers who want to understand the notion of
> Abstract Syntax Tree and more importantly there also people who
> study compilers and researchers who are interested in the Node
> Coordinates Matrix representation of the AST nodes.
> The goal of our project is to create an online tool for
> real time generating AST and NCM from the code in order
> to make the process of exploring these concepts more convenient.

## Features

- ⚙️ Highly customizable
- 👨‍💻️ Support for different programming languages
- 🌍 Sharing
- ✨ Parallel array representation of AST
