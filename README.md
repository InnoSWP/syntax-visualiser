## Motivation

> There are many programmers who want to understand the concept of an
> Abstract Syntax Tree, and, more importantly, there also people who study
> compilers and researchers who are interested in the Node Coordinates Matrix
> representation of the AST. The goal of this project is to create an online
> tool for generating AST and NCM from code in real time to make the process
> of exploring these concepts more convenient.

## Features

- ✨ Node Coordinates Matrix representation of the AST
- 👨‍💻️ Support for different programming languages
- ⚙️ Highly customizable
- 🌍 Sharing

## Examples

> Here be dragons...
